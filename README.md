Thanks for stopping by. I'm a frontend developer that is passionate about UI design that helps people. I am looking for a position where I can learn and grow with a team of cool people that help others.

:seedling: I'm currently learning Vue and really liking it. My latest vue app [live app](https://window-counter.netlify.app/) see the [code](https://github.com/Ongomobile/vue-window-counter-app)

  More stuff about me
 </summary>

â€¢ Being self taught, I know how to solve my own problems, and when to ask for help. I also know how to listen and take feedback. I try my best to ask better questions as I refine my search queries.

â€¢ I love to design and code and learning new skills in this area is my favorite thing to do. I can be stubborn when I want to figure things out so I donâ€™t give up easily. Pixel perfection is my obsession.

â€¢ Helping people is important to me, so finding the root causes of problems is very important to me. Before starting any designs, I need to understand the challenges and goals to be better able to design a plan with empathy.
